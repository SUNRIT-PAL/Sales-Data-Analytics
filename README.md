This project analyzes sales data to provide key insights into customer purchasing behavior and product performance. It includes data cleaning, removal of duplicates, and exploratory data analysis to identify top-selling products. Various visualizations, such as pie charts, are used to showcase sales trends. Additionally, it provides recommendations for building a product recommendation system by identifying patterns, such as suggesting accessories (e.g., charging cables) when a customer buys a particular product (e.g., iPhone or Google phone). The project serves as a foundation for implementing data-driven sales strategies and personalized product recommendations.# Sales-Data-Analytics
